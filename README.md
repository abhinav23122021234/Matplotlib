# Matplotlib

This repository provides a comprehensive walkthrough of Matplotlib’s features and workflows for data visualization in Python. It is designed to guide users—from beginners to advanced—through the process of creating, customizing, and saving plots. All the example code is contained in the `main.py` file. This README explains the purpose and content of each section without including the code itself.

---

## Introduction to Matplotlib

- **Setup and Initialization:**  
  The repository begins by configuring Matplotlib for inline plotting in Jupyter notebooks. It imports essential libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. An initial empty plot is rendered to confirm that Matplotlib is set up correctly.

---

## Basic Plotting

- **Line Plot Example:**  
  A simple line plot is created using a set of sample data. This cell demonstrates how to plot basic x and y data and shows the default output when a plot is generated.

---

## Methods to Create Figures and Axes

The repository explores three different approaches for creating figures and axes:

1. **Using `figure()` with `add_subplot()`:**  
   This method shows how to manually create a figure and then add a subplot to it. It serves as an alternative to the default pyplot plotting method.

2. **Using `figure()` with `add_axes()`:**  
   An example is provided where a figure is created and axes are added with explicit dimensions (using a list of coordinates), offering greater control over the placement of the plot.

3. **Using `subplots()` (Recommended):**  
   The recommended approach simultaneously creates a figure and one or more axes. This method is highlighted as the most flexible and convenient, especially for advanced plotting tasks.

## Example Workflow in Matplotlib

- **End-to-End Workflow:**  
  A detailed workflow is presented that covers:
  - Preparing data for visualization.
  - Setting up a plot with a specified figure size.
  - Plotting the data.
  - Customizing the plot by adding titles, labels, and other annotations.
  - Saving the completed figure as an image file.

---

## Creating Figures with NumPy Arrays

- **Generating Data with NumPy:**  
  The repository explains how to generate a sequence of values using NumPy. It demonstrates:
  - Creating a line plot where the y-values are a function (such as the square) of the generated x-values.
  - Creating scatter plots using functions like the exponential and sine of the generated data.
  - Using NumPy-generated data to produce different types of plots, including line, scatter, bar, and histogram plots.

---

## Plot Types: Scatter, Bar, and Histogram

- **Scatter Plots:**  
  Multiple examples illustrate how to create scatter plots with various functions (e.g., exponential and sine curves) applied to the data.

- **Bar Charts:**  
  A bar chart is constructed using a dictionary of values (for example, nut butter prices). The repository also demonstrates how to create horizontal bar charts.

- **Histograms:**  
  Using randomly generated data, a histogram is created to show the distribution of values. The example includes adjusting the number of bins for finer control over the visualization.

---

## Working with Subplots

- **Multiple Subplots in a Grid:**  
  Two different approaches for creating subplots are described:
  - One method uses nested tuple unpacking to create a grid (e.g., a 2×2 layout) and assigns a different plot to each subplot.
  - Another method utilizes array indexing on the axes object returned by `subplots()` to access and plot on individual subplots.

---

## Plotting from Pandas DataFrames

- **Visualization of Tabular Data:**  
  The repository demonstrates how to load a CSV file (such as a car sales dataset) into a Pandas DataFrame. It covers:
  - Data cleaning steps (e.g., removing currency symbols and formatting numeric columns).
  - Creating additional columns (like a date column and a cumulative total sales column).
  - Plotting various types of graphs directly from the DataFrame, including line plots, scatter plots, and bar graphs.

---

## Working with Additional Datasets

- **Heart Disease Data Example:**  
  Another dataset (heart disease) is introduced. The examples show:
  - Plotting a histogram for the age column.
  - Creating subplots for multiple columns.
  - Demonstrating both quick plotting methods (using the pyplot interface) and more advanced object-oriented approaches for refined control over the plots.

---

## Advanced Customizations and Styling

- **Object-Oriented Plotting Approach:**  
  Advanced examples illustrate how to:
  - Filter data (e.g., selecting individuals over a certain age).
  - Create customized scatter plots that include color coding based on a target variable.
  - Set axis limits, add legends, and insert horizontal lines indicating statistical measures (such as the mean).
  - Create multiple subplots that share a common axis and set an overall figure title.
  
- **Styling with Built-in Themes:**  
  The repository explores the various style options available in Matplotlib. It shows how to switch between different styles (e.g., classic, ggplot, seaborn) to change the visual appearance of the plots.

---

## Saving Figures

- **Exporting Visualizations:**  
  Detailed examples explain how to save the entire figure to various file formats (like PNG or PDF). This ensures that the plots can be easily used in presentations or reports.

---

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a practical guide to mastering Matplotlib. It covers a wide spectrum of topics from basic plotting to advanced customizations and styling. The examples are designed to be easily extendable, enabling users to adapt the techniques to their own data visualization projects.
